var Dreams = ["I showed Shira from my high school in Tel Aviv how to take apart a tea bag so that she could recycle it correctly. We separated the interior of the tea bag from the paper. Afterwards I thought about a new logic that I could incorporate into my dice game website, one that with every dice roll will tell the user which recycling bin to throw the garbage to. I remember thinking about how this new idea can also be a commentary on society, since the action of throwing out the trash is arbitrary and not yet ingrained in our  daily routine.<br>I then found myself with my family in Greece, strolling around the old streets of an obscure Greek city. At some point I got lost and walked on a hill top next to a little sewer pipe and bridge that looked a lot like the sewer pipe near my old house in Kochav Yair. Then I accidentally dropped my phone to the gutter but I was not too concerned about it. I only knew that I should not forget to pick it up from down there. I wanted to go for a walk around that place since it was so pastoral and reminded me of my old house in springtime, and my childhood.","I was in my high school again, and I had a very important algebra exam. I studied for it for a very long time and on the day of the exam my mom said that she will give me a ride from home, which was our old house in Kochav Yair, to school so that I won&rsquo;t be late to the exam. Since the way to school used to take about an hour and a half because of the morning traffic, we woke up early. Right before we headed out, my brother remembered that he had to be in Tel Aviv too that day and wanted to join us for the ride but he still had to get ready. At that point I realized that I will probably be late. After we finally started our way, I suddenly remembered that I forgot to take my calculator with me, so we drove back and I ran back to my house to get it. My brother thought that if I am going back home he would have enough time to finish something he started to do before we left, so he went back home again too. When I heard him say that I felt like I was about to cry from anxiety. I knew that if I had tried to ask him not go and just simply wait for me in the car for a second he would not listen and just do what he wants. I knew at that point that I will be late. <br>When I came back towards the car, our blue gate turned into a huge stainless steel gate with two locks that made it even more difficult for me to get back to the car. When I finally got back it was already 7:22 in the morning and my dad joined us in the car. We started driving again, but before we left my neighborhood a large group of people crossed the road and they were all dressed up in ridiculous costumes of all the countries of the world. Apparently it was the &ldquo;march of the world&rdquo;, and it made us stop the car and wait till everyone crossed the road. During the ride my best friend&rsquo;s parents, Zvike and Ossy, appeared in the car. Zvika noticed that I was studying for my exam and also saw a bunch of documents beside me. He picked up one of the Parsons letters that were there and started to laugh and I felt uncomfortable, as if he was scorning me.","I tried to re-illustrate the dynamics between me and the Interaction class. I spoke with Baki and Andreas specifically about the information that one should disclose once he is registered for this course, like setting up the privacy settings on facebook or other websites. <br>Later that night I came across random people from my life- from Tel Aviv, from NY, from Kochav Yair- apparently they all registered to take the same interaction course.","I was in what seemed like a sorority, with my friends from Israel: Bar, Barr, Dor, Ayala, and others. We acted like we were in a cheap college movie and we decided to throw a party at our huge sorority house. Many people came, and at a certain point a lot of people wanted to take a shower. We were prepared to that situation and we had lots of showers, soaps and shampoos dispersed all over our house.<br> Kevin Walsh started to send me his topless snapchats again, after we have not spoken for almost a year. My phone did not function properly for a few moments and I could not silence it.","Me and my brother were somewhere abroad, in the Israeli super Market called Mega. We were trying to find a good type of fish because we wanted to make a fancy dinner. I looked for a corvina or a Nile Perch or anything that looked familiar, but I could not find any. I got very angry and then I saw my dad, who knows Mega&rsquo;s managers, looking over the situation. So I came up to him and said: &ldquo;Dad, I HATE MEGA,&rdquo; but he did not respond. I figured he silently agreed with me and at the same time was also slightly offended. I somehow realized that the whole communication between everyone in that dream happened in turns, and the way the dream was narrated was very cinematic. I knew in my mind that the only way I could change a person&rsquo;s turn to speak was through the mafia.","I was in my History of Design and Technology recitation class and I just missed the question that the professor had asked. I raised my hand and asked her politely to repeat the question for me, but she apparently took it personally and got furious with me for not paying attention in the first place. I could not understand why she was so disproportionally angry with me, but I also really wanted to know what her question was. I decided to not give up, so I asked her again to repeat the question, and also explained to her why she should repeat it for me. After a ridiculously long and tense conversation in front of the whole class, she gave in and started to cry. I realized that she was not mentally stable because of a romantic incident she had with someone at a party the night before. <br>I went to the cafeteria after class and met up with a few friends of mine that were in a similar situation to my professor&rsquo;s: they kept talking about that party last night and the guys there. While I was talking to my friends, my x-boyfriend and Sagi, the lead singer of his band, showed up and sat at a table close by. I told them I will join them soon, and strangely, I kissed Sagi.","I was at the beach with my mom, dad and brother, and I knew in the back of my mind that after the beach I will go to work at Innovid, the company I used to work for over the summer. I went inside the water and it was so nice, it reminded me of the beaches in Greece.<br> When it was time to go to work, I realized that I actually had to go to my new class &ldquo;Into to Information Design&rdquo; and not work. So I went to school, and the professor wore a black shirt that caught my eye: it had something in English written on it in white but with Hebrew vocalization marks in yellow underneath the letters. It was interesting and made sense only to me since I was the only one in class that knew both Hebrew and English. Unfortunately though, that class was not what I had in mind: the professor was stupid and he gave us a strange assignment: we had to start painting something in acrylics and then continue the assignment at home but switch the medium to writing. I could not understand the connection between this assignment to information design.","I was in some conference in the US that lasted a few days. There were lots of lectures there, and also some group discussions that were led by random people. The people around me were from NYC, my hometown Kochav Yair, and from my highs chool and Tel Aviv. I wore my mom&rsquo;s old blue shoes with the small heel, and I remember taking them off in one of the indoor lectures.<br> After that lecture session we switched to a different room and I remember having my shoes on again, but I could not remember myself actually putting them on. The next lecture was outside and was led by my army commander Maman. When he started to talk I suddenly realized that I did not have my shoes on anymore so I tried to trace my steps back to the first lecture where I took them off. On my way back there I ran into some familiar faces and said hi. It was nice overall, and I did not feel too stressed about it.","I was in Neil&rsquo;s Typography class and we needed to build a website. We were not in the usual classroom, but instead we were somewhere abroad, and it was refreshing. The way in which we coded the site was slightly different from Brian&rsquo;s way of coding; it was a little more structured. But before we actually started to code the website, we had a discussion about the deadliest weapons now existing in the world. Along with the atom bomb, we talked about another, underestimated weapon, that we should be very cautious of: the porcupine&rsquo;s farts.","I was in Andrew&rsquo;s typography class and we were working on some fashion shoot. Morgan from my class and another guy I have never seen before were the models, and their photos turned out amazing.<br> After their turn other people from the class took photos. While I was waiting for my turn for the photo shoot I went for a walk around the hostel we were in, which was run by an old Chinese lady. I came across a tiny room with 3 pairs of second-hand shoes and I considered taking a pair for myself because I thought they did not belong to anyone. But as I grabbed a pair, the old Chinese lady saw me and was very angry so she started to yell at me. Then my friends Bar and Dor from Israel appeared and tried to defend me.<br> I managed to get away from that mess and found a public phone that had &ldquo;Accepts Israel Calls&rdquo; written on it. I put 20 cents in and thought that it would be enough for a phone call home, but it was not so it did not work.","I was in the army again on reserve in my old commander&rsquo;s team, and this time I viewed the army environment from a different perspective. Landi&rsquo;s team was always considered to be the cooler team because they did not always do what was right and proper, whereas Maman was considered an ass because he always had his team do the correct thing that was expected. I had a brief conversation with Maman about how Anni used to steal stuff from the army, and I completely igrnored the fact that I used to do that too. Later we want to eat lunch at the cafeteria, only this time  it was not run by Gigi. Everyone skipped the real food part and went straight to the next room where all the Sufganiot (Hanukkah doughnuts) were.","My brother and I were in my old house again in Kochav Yair, and we were very curious to find out how Meshulam&rsquo;s (our neighbor&rsquo;s) house looked like from the inside. When we decided to go in, we were surprised to see a total chaos and a lot of construction ruins. Then we realized that we were actually inside the Louvre in Paris, and that everything was a game. We tried to decide whether we should keep playing this game, or retire and look at the works of art in the Louvre. Then, something there was very smelly, and it  turned out to be a fish head. I had to pick it up and throw it away to the trash, but I did it very sluggishly because a boy that was a part of the game kept talking to me. Then I realized that I was standing on my knees in a narrow hallway, and all of the Louvre&rsquo;s visitors and tourists had to go over my calves in order to get to the other side of the hallway. One Mexican family walked over my calves and stopped to admire my tattoo (that I do not actually have) of a rake, on the back side of my left calve. According to the little Mexican girl, the rake was an ancient Mexican symbol for winter. Then, I was in a car with Oren Parnas which was a kid I knew from elementary school. He owed me a lot of money, and he gave it all back in very very small coins that people used to use decades ago, in addition to a jar of vitamins. When I came home I gave the little coins to my dad, and went to the kitchen to heat the jar of vitamins in the microwave. I accidentally over-heated them and their chemical compound turned toxic. I gave it to the kid that I talked to in Meshulam&rsquo;s house, and said that now these vitamins are like drugs- they make you feel numb and have side affects that resemble to an allergic reaction where the head swells and the body shivers. He wanted to take the vitamins because he liked the feeling and he missed it, but he also knew how to stay in control. My brother and I watched how it affects him while he was explaining what he was feeling and it was interesting.","I was in my old house in Kochav Yair with my brother and I wanted to wear a dress, I put on my Yellow summer dress that I made and he said: &ldquo;Oh! this is the prettiest dress you own!&rdquo; Then we went to some dark vacation house in an obscure place and I had to pee, so I went to the basement to look for the bathroom. When I tried to flush down the water they barely flushed and instead the water rose above the toilet seat and water began to run out of tap nearby. It was disgusting and annoying but I dealt with it.","There was some kind of a way in which I could change a scene&rsquo;s background color, the time and the fact the me and Mihn kissed, with a mouse click using javascript. Then all of the Interaction class went to a restaurant and me and Mihn kissed haphazardly, without noticing that the whole class was there too and I thought I was actually kissing Mark. After realizing that everyone saw that, I freaked out and went outside to a large meadow to organize my thoughts. I went to take a shower at my house that was apparently close by, and when I came back everyone had already finished eating and had gotten their doggy bags. It frustrated me so I took all the leftovers and ate them. Then Mihn looked at me in a funny way like he did not understand what was going through my mind.","My dad told me that there was an opening ceremony for the new swimming pool in Tel Aviv, so I went there with my friends from Israel. My friend Ayala worked there as a caterer, and I went to chat with her. Then I ended up sitting next to Tamir, a guy that I do not appreciate at all and that is also here in New York studying as a part-time student in Parsons. I tried to walk away from his company and went to hang out with Ayala and Yair again. Me and Yair tried to tell her a funny story about a how Yair invented a word when he wanted to ask me what was my favorite music (Moole). We wanted to act it out for her, and when Yair asked her the same question, she suddenly turned into my firend Dorin, that loves to talk excessively about Israeli rock music.","I was in a place where students stay during winter break to pass the time. Then my friend started to do drugs, and when I walked around between that campus, I walked into his room and ran into some sketchy people that were looking for him because he apparently owed them a lot of money. Then I found myself on the higher level of my old house&rsquo;s garden in Kochav Yair. I tried to pick pears from our pear tree that was covered with huge pears, but as I got closer to it I realized that huge flies had poked holes in all the fruit and I could not eat any of them.","There was a space with buttons that could add and drop classes and affect the entire appearance of the dream. At one point, the atmosphere resembled to the atmosphere in the movie Dumbo.","My family came to NY to visit me and we went to buy me some new winter boots at Urban Outfitters. When we came there, we found out that a huge section of the store had shut down because of construction and instead they had put up temporary restrooms. Mark was there and was amused by the fact that he tried to code a program that could change his shoes automatically. It was funny. The store seemed to me like Disneyland now, and a lot of tourists that wanted to experience the whole &ldquo;Urban Outfitters experience&rdquo; started to pour in and take photos.","I was in some public place with Kathryn, Baki, Mark, Andreas and Mihn and it felt like we were a part of a computer game. Then Baki danced in a funny way and then he realized that his fingertips were colored in glittery green paint. I was very excited about it and when he came to show it to me he accidentally stained my pink shirt with it. I ran to the bathroom to wash it off and I knew it was stalling everyone that wanted to leave. Then when I came back, the place changed and there were a bunch of marble figurines around me. I had to figure out which one was related to religion, and when I found the Santa Maria, I had to write it down in code so that a recording by Arik Ainstein could be played in the background with a voiceover explaining why he was so influential to Israeli culture.","My friends and I hung out in my old 9th grade classroom in Tel Aviv. We sat next to the piano that was next to the classroom door, and then one of the teachers said that that we had to move and hang out somewhere else because the current 9th graders studied there. So we suggested to her that we move to her office since there is no piano there and she said &ldquo;okay&rdquo; in a very maternal way, as if she did not really want us to be there, but then on the other hand she wanted us to be happy and satisfied."];
