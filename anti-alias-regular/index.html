              About Anti-Alias
            </h2>
            <p>
              Anti Alias began as an exploration of the quality of high-resolution typefaces when rendered on a low-resolution screen. It takes its name from the technique used to minimizing the distortion artifacts that result form the shift between high-res to low-res displays.
            </p>
            <p>
              In computer graphics, anti aliasing improves the appearance of polygon edges, so they are not "jagged" but are smoothed out on the screen, by determining what percentage of the pixel is occupied by a given region and using that percentage as the color. In an anti-aliased mode and when the resolution is insufficient to show the detail of a typeface, the edges of each letter blend into gray and appear much smoother.
            </p>
            <p>
              The familyâ€™s building blocks are composed of diagonal lines varying in width and density; the thicker and more dense the lines are, the darker the area looks from a distance. It presents the visual quality of a blown-up anti-aliased typeface, while working around the limitations of type-design softwares that are lacking the option to set different opacities to glyph paths. 
            </p>

              Anti Alias is designed by Maurann Stein.
